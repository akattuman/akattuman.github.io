title: Comparison of Forms for Writing on the Internet

# Initial Caveats

## Definitions

I have not defined the terms 'blog post' and 'evergreen note' (yet).

## Beyond Writing?

There's a blurry line between piece of writing and a piece of writing on the internet with interactive features. At a certain threshold, the interactivity becomes a load-bearing aspect of the writing[^alt-text]; these forms are beyond the scope of this note[^twitter-thread].

# (Distinguishing?) Features

## Varying States of Completion

A note can be published in an unfinished state, in the knowledge that the gaps can be filled in later.

A blog post is published when it's finished.

### Publication Date

> *The first thing you do when you take a piece of paper is always put the date on it, the month, the day, and where it is ... when you look for what you wrote down in your notes, you will be desperate to know that it happened in April in 1972 and it was in Paris and already it begins to be useful.*
> 
> -- Francis Ford Coppola

To my mind, a key feature of the blog post is the presence of a definite 'published on' date. 

This is not a sharp dividing line. Blog posts can be updated, and evergreen notes can obviously maintain a history of dates on which additions were made. Nevertheless, blog posts are typically understood within a specific temporal context (both for the author and for the world), in a way that notes often aren't[^muddied-context]. The publication date is a central piece of metadata for blogs.


## Predetermined vs Emergent Structure

## Originality

Notes need not make any claims of originality. They can simply be the 'exhaust' of a process of thinking through some idea. For example, you can easily imagine two students writing up near-identical notes as they both grapple with the max-flow min-cut theorem. As a result, the status of evergreen notes as published works can be more complicated.

### Authorship

In the case of a blog, the role of the author is larger[^author-metadata] and so there is less scope for reproducing another person's post... This gets back to the key question of 'what purpose does this piece of writing serve?' 

## Durability

### Ownership

## Context and Nesting

## Citation

### Canonical Versions

## Links

## Indexing

A chronological list is a meaningful way to view blog posts, but there is no obvious structure through which to view a set of notes. This leaves a difficult question of how to surface them.


[^alt-text]: One litmus test might be 'can you replace the interactive components with some kind of alt text and still make sense of the writing?' An example that should pass this test is a blog post with an embedded video. An example that should fail might be some kind of a visualiser to scrub through different versions of a piece of writing.

[^twitter-thread]: I will not apply this rule consistently... You could definitely argue that tweets are too interactive for this. This is most clear in the case of citing a tweet. If it is a reply, the relevant context is a Twitter conversation with multiple participants, whose structure (chronological? tree?) may be too complex for this note.

[^muddied-context]: If a note is updated over many years, it is harder to place its thoughts and ideas into a historical context. A counter-point may be that this context may be extracted if version control is maintained (i.e. knowing when lines where changed/added), but my point is **that is probably not a first-class property of the piece of writing itself**. It is not available to the reader in an ergonomic way. This may need further defence, because the line between data and metadata can be blurred...

[^author-metadata]: You could say that the author field is another important piece of metadata. For notes, this seems less important.
